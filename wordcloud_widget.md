## What is a WordCloud
***
In this lesson we will learn about a WordCloud and some of the parameters we can change to help us to gain insight into our data.  A wordcloud is a visualization that takes in a string and outputs a graph of the words in the string with the size of the text correlating to the frequency of the word.  The higher the frequency, the larger the text will be. In the interactive console below you can manipulate some of the arguments for the wordcloud by dragging the sliders, checking and unchecking boxes, or selecting options for the dropdown boxes. If you would like to learn more about the arguments, you can check out the documentation <a href="https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/generated/wordcloud.WordCloud.html" target="-blank">here.</a>
