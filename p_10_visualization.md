# Comparing the Repetitiveness of Songs

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Compare the repetiveness of lyrics of songs from 8 decades
* Graph the percent of reptitition
* Visualize a comparison of the songs repetitiveness

## Camparing songs from many decades

***

In this lesson, you'll be analyzing the number 1 pop song from the top of each decade.  In the notebook linked below we have imported and cleaned the lyrics from the top song of the first year of each decade.  You can visualize each song individually using a function we created called `make_bar_plot`. This function will graph the top number frequencies of the song you chose by passing the arguments `song_name`, `top_n`. 

For example, if you want the top 5 most occurring lyrics in the song 'hold_on' you can enter `make_bar_plot('hold_on', 5)` and you'll see the resulting bar chart be rendered.

## Try it out

***

You can try out the `make_bar_plot()` function for yourself.  Choose a title to pass into the function from the list above, and a number of top lyrics to visualize.  You can just pass a song name and the function will default to the top 10.  

Click on the link below to see this for yourself.  The link will take you to a read only version of a notebook that you can then save a copy and try changing some of the code to see how it affects the output.

## Recap

***

In this lesson, you took a look at the repetitiveness of many songs and compared them using some visualizations.  Next we will review what you have learned and discover the doors this has opened.
