## What did we learn?

***

In this module you were introduced to a very simple song analysis.  You learned some Python basics including data types like: 
- string
- list
- set
You were given an introduction to variables and how to assign a value to a variable.  

You were also introduced to a few methods to work with strings:
- `.replace()`
- `.lower()`
- `.split()`

Then you learned about a few of the different collections in Python like sets, dictionaries, and lists and dove into some of the ways to work with lists and dictionaries.

Then we looked at a few ways to visualoze data to help to gain insight into some of the characteristics of the data.  You got to interact with a WordCloud and see how the different parameters of the function affect the outcome of the wordcloud itself.

Finally you were able to see a full notebook with the code to load, clean, organize, and visualize the data all together.

## Recap

***

This was a brief look into a simple analysis project woth an introduction to a few of the fundamental items used in Data Science.  In the Flatiron School Data Science program you can learn about Python and how it is used in Data Science to turn data into insight.
