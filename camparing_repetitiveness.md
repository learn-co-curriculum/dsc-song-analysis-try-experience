# Comparing the Repetitiveness of Songs

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Compare the repetiveness of lyrics of songs from 8 decades
* Graph the percent of reptitition
* Visualize a comparison of the songs repetitiveness

## Camparing songs from many decades

***

In this lesson, we are going to analyze the number 1 pop song from the top of each decade.  In the code console below we have imported and cleaned the lyrics from the top song of the first year of each decade.  You can visualize each song individually using a function we created called `make_bar_plot`.  This function will graph the top number frequencies of the song you chose by passin the arguements `song_name`, `top_n`. For example, if you wanted the top 5 most occurring lyrics in the song 'hold_on' you would enter `make_bar_plot('hold_on', 5)` and you would see the resulting bar chart be rendered.

## Try it out

***

You can try out the `make_bar_plot()` function for yourself.  To see a list of the song names, you can enter `print(titles)` then chose a title to pass into the function, and a number of top lyrics to visualize.  You can just pass a song name and the function will default to the top 10.  Try it out in the console below, remember you need to click the green arrow to initialize the console.

In this lesson we took a look at the repetitiveness of many songs and compared them using some visualizations.
