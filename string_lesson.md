# The string data type `str`

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Use the **string** `str` data type
* Create a string in the interactive code console

## Load the data

***

To solve this problem with code, we do something similar to the index card method we discussed in the last lesson which is to organize our lyrics into a **list**.  We start with our words in a **string**. We will learn about **strings** below, but first, let's see how it looks:


```python
"Ah, Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Oh Barbara Ann Take My Hand Barbara Ann You Got Me Rockin' And A-Rollin' Rockin' And A-Reelin' Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann ...More Lyrics... Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann"
```


"Ah, Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Oh Barbara Ann Take My Hand Barbara Ann You Got Me Rockin' And A-Rollin' Rockin' And A-Reelin' Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann ...More Lyrics... Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann Ba Ba Ba Ba Barbara Ann"

> **Note:** What you see above in the first gray box is Python code - that is the code you would write.  What comes below that box is the output generated after running the code. So the output of creating a string is jest that same string - not very interesting.

## String `str` data type
***

Information in Python can be in many formats or data types, the most basic of these data types is a character, which is simply a letter, number or some other form of punctuation.  When we put these characters together, we form what is called a *string*. To create a **string** in Python, we place quotes at the start and end of text. The single quotes `''` and double quotes `""` are used interchangeably in python and if we don't encase the **string** in either single or double quotes, Python will not create a string and may give us an error.

## Interactive code console

***

Below is an interactive code console. It allows you to write and run code so you can see the results for yourself. First, you'll need to **initialize the console by clicking the green arrow**, then you can type any commands or code at the prompt as indicated by the arrow in the illustration below.

## Try it out
***

Great, now let's try to input something as a **string** - we'll start with something simple:  
`'Hello World'` or `"Hello World"`  
In the console below we can print ‘Hello World’ using the `print()` function, which looks like this:  
```python
print('Hello World')
```

Type this command in the code console below, then try it without the quotes, like this:
  
```python
print(Hello World)
```  

and look at the error message you encounter.

So, to avoid errors, we need quotes around our text to make a string.  Great, we know how to input some data, now let's learn how we can store that data so we can access it when we want it.

## Recap

***

In this lesson we learned about strings.  We learned that a string is just a group of characters and how to create and how not to create one. We also got a chance to use the interactive code console and write some code for ourselves. Now we will take a look at variables and how they store the information for us.
